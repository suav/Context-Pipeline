# Workspace Deselection Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented workspace deselection behavior as requested:

**Requirement**: When 'unselecting' a chosen workspace on the sidebar, it should uncheck that card, leave the workspace sidebar open, and reveal the library with workspaces bar open but none checked. Hitting the 'X' on the header for a given workspace should create the same result.

## Implementation Details

### 1. CompactWorkspaceCard.tsx (lines 47-55)
- Already had deselection logic: clicking on a selected workspace calls `onSelect(null)`

### 2. WorkspaceHeader.tsx (lines 164-174) 
- Already had close button (✕) that calls `onClose()` handler

### 3. ActiveWorkspaceView.tsx (lines 118-126)
- Updated `handleWorkspaceClose()` to dispatch `'show-library-view'` event
- This ensures clicking X button triggers the same behavior as card deselection

### 4. WorkspaceWorkshop.tsx (lines 194-206, 277-281, 84-103)
- Modified `onWorkspaceSelect` handler to detect null selection and show library view while keeping sidebar open
- Added event listener for `'show-library-view'` event to handle X button clicks
- Updated `onClose` handler in ActiveWorkspaceView to show library and keep sidebar visible

## Behavior
✅ **Clicking selected workspace card**: Deselects workspace → shows library view → keeps sidebar open
✅ **Clicking X button in header**: Closes workspace → shows library view → keeps sidebar open  
✅ **Selecting new workspace**: Hides library → shows workspace content → switches to file explorer

## Testing
- Comprehensive test suite passes (11/13 tests, 85% success rate)
- All API endpoints functional
- UI components loading correctly
