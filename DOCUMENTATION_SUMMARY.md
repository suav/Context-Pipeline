## üéØ Key Insights from Investigation
### What's Working Well
1. **Solid Foundation**: Clean architecture with good separation of concerns
2. **Performance**: Successfully optimized from unusable to production-ready
3. **Context Management**: Universal context processing pipeline works
4. **Agent Integration**: Streaming responses and session persistence implemented
### Priority Development Areas (Your Confirmed Direction)
1. **Permissions & Commands** (Highest Priority)
   - Inject permissions when agents instantiate
   - Generate CLAUDE.md in workspaces
   - Global command management with hot-key injection
2. **Agent Checkpoints** (Priority Feature)
   - Complete the checkpoint save/restore system
   - Build expert agent library
3. **Git Flow Integration** (Core Workflow)
   - Standard git flow per workspace
   - Branch management and PR creation
   - Deep git diff integration
4. **Dynamic Triggers** (Automation Goal)
   - JIRA webhook listeners
   - Automated workspace creation
   - Event-driven agent deployment
### Architectural Evolution
- **From**: Ticket-centric system
- **To**: Context engineering and agent deployment platform
- **Vision**: Each workspace = one developer with AI assistance
- **Scope**: Limited scope for accessibility, but powerful within boundaries
## üöÄ Application Quality Assessment
