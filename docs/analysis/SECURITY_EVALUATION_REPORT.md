## Security Patterns Checked
This evaluation checked for the following security patterns:
### CRITICAL Severity
- **Use of eval() function - code injection risk**
  - Recommendation: Replace eval() with safer alternatives like JSON.parse() or Function constructor
- **Use of document.write() - XSS vulnerability**
  - Recommendation: Use safer DOM manipulation methods like createElement() and appendChild()
- **Dynamic innerHTML assignment - XSS risk**
  - Recommendation: Use textContent or createElement() for dynamic content
- **Environment variable exposure in client code**
  - Recommendation: Ensure environment variables are only used server-side
### HIGH Severity
- **Storing sensitive data in localStorage**
  - Recommendation: Use secure storage methods or encrypt sensitive data
- **Storing tokens in sessionStorage without encryption**
  - Recommendation: Consider httpOnly cookies or encrypted storage
- **Insecure HTTP requests**
  - Recommendation: Use HTTPS for all API requests
- **Use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML - XSS risk**
  - Recommendation: Sanitize content or use safer alternatives
- **Command execution functions - injection risk**
  - Recommendation: Validate and sanitize all inputs to exec functions
### MEDIUM Severity
- **Use of Math.random() for security purposes**
  - Recommendation: Use crypto.randomBytes() for cryptographic purposes
- **Logging sensitive information**
  - Recommendation: Remove sensitive data from console logs
- **Sensitive information in comments**
  - Recommendation: Remove sensitive information from comments
- **Security-related TODO/FIXME comments**
  - Recommendation: Address security-related TODO items before production
### LOW Severity
- **Use of alert() function**
  - Recommendation: Use proper notification components instead of alert()
- **Use of confirm() function**
  - Recommendation: Use proper modal components instead of confirm()
- **Use of var keyword**
  - Recommendation: Use let or const instead of var for better scoping
