# Context Pipeline - Development Workflow
## Multi-Agent Parallel Development
## 🎯 Overview
Five independent development streams are now set up with dedicated git branches. Each agent works on isolated features with minimal conflicts, enabling true parallel development.
## 🌳 Branch Structure
```
main (protected)
├── feature/permissions-system    # Agent A - HIGHEST PRIORITY
├── feature/checkpoint-system     # Agent B - HIGH PRIORITY
├── feature/git-operations        # Agent C - HIGH PRIORITY
├── feature/context-import        # Agent D - MEDIUM PRIORITY
└── feature/ui-improvements       # Agent E - MEDIUM PRIORITY
```
All branches have been created and pushed to origin. Ready for agent assignment.

## 🔄 Daily Workflow
### **Phase 1: Agent Setup**
Each agent should:
1. Checkout their assigned branch: `git checkout feature/[branch-name]`
2. Review their work package in `AGENT_WORK_PACKAGES.md`
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin Phase 1 tasks
### **Phase 2: Development Process**
**Daily Routine:**
1. **Morning**: Sync with main if needed
2. **Development**: Work on assigned tasks
3. **Testing**: Run `node scripts/test-comprehensive.js`
4. **Commit**: Push progress daily
5. **Communication**: Update progress in daily standup
**Weekly Routine:**
1. **Monday**: Rebase from main if needed
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week progress check
3. **Friday**: Demo current functionality
### **Phase 3: Integration Preparation**
Before creating pull requests:
1. **Full Testing**: Run all test suites
2. **Code Review**: Self-review all changes
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs
4. **Rebase**: Final rebase from main
## 🧪 Testing Requirements
### **Mandatory Tests (All Agents)**
```bash
# Must pass before any commit
node scripts/test-comprehensive.js
# Recommended for UI changes
node scripts/setup-puppeteer-testing.js
# Manual verification
npm start # Test at http://localhost:3001
```
### **Feature-Specific Tests**
Each agent should create and maintain tests for their specific features in their branch.
## 📋 Communication Protocol
### **Daily Standups**
**Questions to Address:**
1. What did you complete yesterday?
2. What will you work on today?
3. Any blockers or dependencies?
4. Any shared interface changes needed?
### **Conflict Prevention**
- **AgentService.ts**: Coordinate changes, different methods per agent
- **Types**: Communicate type changes in advance
- **Package.json**: No changes without approval
- **API Routes**: Ensure no overlapping endpoints
## 🎯 Success Milestones

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures
### **Merge Conflicts**
1. Communicate immediately in daily standup
2. Coordinate resolution with affected agents
3. Document resolution approach
4. Update shared interfaces if needed
### **Blocking Issues**
1. Agent A has highest priority - unblock immediately
2. Cross-dependencies require coordination
3. Infrastructure issues affect all agents
### **Quality Issues**
1. All tests must pass before PR
2. Code review required for all changes
3. Performance regressions block merges
## 📈 Progress Tracking
Track progress using GitHub issues, branch commits, and this shared document. Each agent should:
1. **Commit daily** with clear messages
2. **Update documentation** as features develop
3. **Communicate blockers** immediately
4. **Test continuously** to avoid integration issues
## 🏁 Completion Criteria
