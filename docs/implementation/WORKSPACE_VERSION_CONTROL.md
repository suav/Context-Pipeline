# Workspace Version Control & Deployment System
## Overview
This document outlines the future version control and deployment features for workspace management, enabling teams to safely test, merge, and deploy multiple workspace changes together.
## Core Features
### 1. Workspace Combination & Testing
**Multi-Workspace Selection**
- Select multiple workspaces to combine into a unified testing branch
- Automatically detect and resolve conflicts between workspaces
- Create a "combined testing" branch that includes all selected changes
**Conflict Resolution**
- Automated conflict detection across all selected workspaces
- Interactive conflict resolution UI
- Ensure all workspaces can merge cleanly before proceeding
### 2. Custom Deployment Pipeline
**Testing Environment Deployment**
- Custom deploy scripts per testing environment
- Deploy combined workspace changes to testing environments
- Automated rollback capabilities if issues are detected
**Deployment Configuration**
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "test_env": {
      "script": "./deploy/test.sh",
      "variables": {
        "ENV": "test",
        "BRANCH": "{combined_branch_name}"
      }
    },
    "staging_env": {
      "script": "./deploy/staging.sh",
      "pre_checks": ["lint", "test", "security-scan"]
    }
  }
}
```
### 3. Batch Pull Request Management
**Batch PR Creation**
- Create individual PRs for each workspace
- Ensure all PRs can merge cleanly
- Link related PRs for coordinated review
**PR Validation**
- Pre-flight checks for merge conflicts
- Dependency validation between PRs
- Automated CI/CD integration
### 4. Continuous Synchronization
**Upstream Updates**
- Regular synchronization with main branches
- Automatic updates when workspace branches' PRs are merged
- Merge back into the remote branch they spawned from
**Feedback Loop**
- Post-release feedback collection
- Triggered updates to pull in other developers' changes
- Maintain workspace branch freshness
## Workflow Example
1. **Select Workspaces**
   - Choose workspaces: "BD Column Feature", "Contract Email Fix", "User Management Update"
2. **Create Combined Branch**
   - System creates: `combined-test-2025-06-28-feature-bundle`
   - Validates all changes can merge cleanly
3. **Deploy to Test**
   - Run custom deployment script
   - Monitor deployment status
   - Collect initial feedback
4. **Create Batch PRs**
   - Individual PR for each workspace
   - All PRs reference the combined testing results
   - Coordinated review process
5. **Merge & Sync**
   - Merge approved PRs
   - Update all workspace branches with latest changes
   - Close feedback loop
## Data Model
```typescript
interface CombinedDeployment {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  workspaces: string[];
  combined_branch: string;
  status: 'testing' | 'review' | 'merged' | 'failed';
  pull_requests: {
    workspace_id: string;
    pr_number: number;
    status: string;
  }[];
  deployment_logs: {
    environment: string;
    timestamp: string;
    status: string;
    logs: string;
  }[];
}
```
## Integration Points
- Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- CI/CD systems
- Deployment platforms
- Monitoring and feedback systems
## Future Enhancements
- Automated rollback on failure detection
- A/B testing support for feature deployments
- Performance impact analysis
- Dependency graph visualization
