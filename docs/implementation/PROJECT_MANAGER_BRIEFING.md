## üîÑ Git Branching Strategy
### **Branch Structure:**
```
main (protected)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/permissions-system (Agent A)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/checkpoint-system (Agent B)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/git-operations (Agent C)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/context-import (Agent D)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/ui-improvements (Agent E)
```
### **Branch Rules:**
1. **All branches from main**: Each agent starts from latest main
2. **No cross-feature dependencies**: Each branch is independent
3. **Regular rebasing**: Agents rebase from main weekly
4. **PR requirements**: Full test suite + code review required
5. **Merge order**: Permissions first, then others in parallel
### **Conflict Prevention:**
- **Shared types**: Coordinate changes in daily standups
- **AgentService.ts**: Different methods per agent, minimal overlap
- **Package.json**: Changes go through main branch only
- **Testing**: Each agent validates independently
## ‚ö° Development Workflow
### **Phase 1: Setup (Day 1)**
```bash
# Each agent creates their branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/[agent-name]-[feature]
git push -u origin feature/[agent-name]-[feature]
```
### **Phase 2: Development (Weeks 1-2)**
**Daily Process:**
1. **Morning**: Pull latest main, rebase if needed
2. **Development**: Work on assigned feature
3. **Testing**: Run `node scripts/test-comprehensive.js`
4. **Commit**: Push progress to feature branch
5. **Evening**: Update progress in shared document
**Weekly Process:**
1. **Monday**: Sync with main branch
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week progress review
3. **Friday**: Demo current functionality
### **Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)**
1. **Code Review**: All agents review each other's PRs
2. **Integration Testing**: Test all features together
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Address any merge conflicts
4. **Final Testing**: Full system validation
### **Phase 4: Deployment (Week 4)**
1. **Staged Merge**: Merge features one by one
2. **Validation**: Test after each merge
3. **Documentation**: Update all documentation
4. **Release**: Deploy to production
## üß™ Testing Strategy
### **Individual Agent Testing:**
```bash
# Required for every commit
node scripts/test-comprehensive.js
# Recommended for UI changes
node scripts/setup-puppeteer-testing.js
# Manual testing
npm start
# Test your feature at http://localhost:3001
```
### **Integration Testing:**
```bash
# After merging branches
npm run build
npm start
node scripts/test-comprehensive.js
# Manual testing of all features together
```
### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All individual tests pass (85%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] UI components work together
- [ ] All APIs functional
## üìä Progress Tracking

## üö® Risk Management
### **Technical Risks:**
1. **Merge Conflicts**: Mitigated by clear boundaries and daily syncs
2. **Interface Changes**: Mitigated by communication and reviews
3. **Testing Failures**: Mitigated by continuous testing requirements
4. **Performance Issues**: Mitigated by regular performance testing
### **Process Risks:**
1. **Agent Availability**: Have backup plans for critical features
2. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined boundaries
3. **Integration Complexity**: Plan integration week carefully
4. **Quality Issues**: Mandate testing and reviews
### **Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each agent owns specific files/features
- **Regular Communication**: Daily standups and weekly reviews
- **Continuous Testing**: Test requirements for every commit
- **Backup Plans**: Critical features (permissions) have priority
