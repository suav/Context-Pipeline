# Context Pipeline - UI Testing Framework

Comprehensive Puppeteer-based testing suite for validating all critical UI workflows in headful mode.

## üéØ Overview

This testing framework validates that Context Pipeline's UI workflows remain functional and well-styled. Tests run in **headful mode** for visual validation and cover all critical user journeys.

## üìã Test Structure

### Individual Test Scripts
- `01-basic-ui-validation.js` - Theme switching, navigation, responsive design
- `02-credentials-management.js` - JIRA/Git credential CRUD operations  
- `03-import-and-library.js` - Content import from all sources + library management
- `04-workspace-lifecycle.js` - Workspace creation, drafts, publishing, unpublishing
- `05-agent-interaction.js` - Agent deployment, chat, navigation persistence
- `06-file-editor-operations.js` - Monaco editor, file tree, CRUD operations
- `07-git-integration.js` - Git diff viewing, branch operations, staging
- `08-advanced-features.js` - Checkpoints, permissions, search, commands

### Pathway Test Suites
- `pathways/foundation-pathway.js` - Core UI + Credentials (must pass first)
- `pathways/content-pathway.js` - Import + Library Management
- `pathways/workflow-pathway.js` - Workspaces + Agents (core value prop)
- `pathways/integration-pathway.js` - Files + Git + Advanced Features

## üöÄ Running Tests

### Quick Test (3-5 minutes)
Tests foundation only - good for rapid validation:
```bash
node scripts/puppeteer-tests/run-quick-test.js
```

### Full Test Suite (15-20 minutes)
Comprehensive testing of all workflows:
```bash
node scripts/puppeteer-tests/run-all-tests.js
```

### Individual Tests
Run specific test scripts:
```bash
node scripts/puppeteer-tests/01-basic-ui-validation.js
node scripts/puppeteer-tests/05-agent-interaction.js
# etc.
```

## üìä Test Pathways Explained

### 1. Foundation Pathway (CRITICAL)
**Dependencies**: None  
**Tests**: Basic UI + Credentials  
**Why Critical**: Nothing else works without proper UI and credential management

**Key Validations**:
- Theme switching works and persists
- Navigation is functional
- Settings modal opens/closes
- Credential CRUD operations work
- JIRA and Git credentials can be created/edited/deleted

### 2. Content Pathway
**Dependencies**: Foundation Pathway  
**Tests**: Import + Library Management  
**Purpose**: Validates content can be imported and organized

**Key Validations**:
- JIRA import works with credentials
- Git repository import functions
- File upload accepts various formats
- Text import processes correctly
- Library items can be searched, filtered, archived

### 3. Workflow Pathway (CORE VALUE)
**Dependencies**: Foundation + Content  
**Tests**: Workspaces + Agents  
**Purpose**: Validates the primary user journey and value proposition

**Key Validations**:
- Workspaces can be created from library items
- Draft/publish workflow functions
- Agents can be deployed successfully
- Chat interaction works with streaming responses
- Navigation persistence (nav away and back, conversation remains)
- Agent memory and context work across sessions

### 4. Integration Pathway
**Dependencies**: All previous pathways  
**Tests**: Files + Git + Advanced Features  
**Purpose**: Validates advanced IDE-like functionality

**Key Validations**:
- Monaco editor loads and functions
- File tree operations work (create, edit, delete, rename)
- Git diff viewing and branch operations
- Advanced features like checkpoints and permissions
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility

## üîß Test Requirements

### Prerequisites
1. **Server Running**: `npm run dev` on port 3001
2. **Chrome/Chromium**: Installed and accessible
3. **Test Data**: Some library items for workspace creation (optional)

### Browser Requirements
- Tests run in **headful mode** for visual validation
- Chrome/Chromium must be installed
- Tests will keep browser open briefly between phases for observation

## üì∏ Test Output

### Screenshots
All tests capture screenshots at key moments:
- `screenshots/01-basic-ui/` - UI validation screenshots
- `screenshots/02-credentials/` - Credential management screens
- `screenshots/05-agent-interaction/` - Agent chat and navigation
- etc.

### Results
- `results/comprehensive-test-results.json` - Detailed JSON results
- `results/test-report.html` - Visual HTML report
- `results/*-results.json` - Individual test results

### Console Output
Tests provide real-time feedback:
- ‚úÖ Passed operations
- ‚ùå Failed operations  
- üì∏ Screenshot captures
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Pauses for visual validation

## üéØ Critical Workflows Tested

### User Journey 1: Setup and Configuration
1. Access application ‚Üí Basic UI loads properly
2. Open settings ‚Üí Credentials manager accessible
3. Add JIRA credential ‚Üí Validation and storage work
4. Add Git credential ‚Üí Multiple credential types supported

### User Journey 2: Content Import and Organization
1. Access import ‚Üí Import modal opens with all source options
2. Import from JIRA ‚Üí Credential selection and import process
3. Import from Git ‚Üí Repository cloning and file extraction
4. Organize in library ‚Üí Search, filter, archive functions

### User Journey 3: Workspace and Agent Interaction (CORE)
1. Create workspace ‚Üí Select library items and publish
2. Enter workspace ‚Üí File explorer and editor interface load
3. Deploy agent ‚Üí Agent becomes available for interaction
4. Chat with agent ‚Üí Streaming responses and tool usage
5. Navigate away ‚Üí Return to same workspace
6. Verify persistence ‚Üí Conversation and context maintained

### User Journey 4: Development Workflow
1. Edit files ‚Üí Monaco editor with syntax highlighting
2. View git diff ‚Üí Changes displayed properly
3. Use advanced features ‚Üí Checkpoints, permissions, search
4. Test performance ‚Üí System remains responsive

## üö® Failure Handling

### Foundation Pathway Failure
**Impact**: Critical - all other functionality blocked  
**Action**: Fix immediately before proceeding

### Content Pathway Failure  
**Impact**: Medium - workspaces can't be created with content  
**Action**: Check credential configuration and import APIs

### Workflow Pathway Failure
**Impact**: Critical - core value proposition broken  
**Action**: Primary development priority

### Integration Pathway Failure
**Impact**: Low-Medium - advanced features affected  
**Action**: Core functionality still works, fix for full feature set

## üí° Development Usage

### During Feature Development
```bash
# Quick validation of foundation
node scripts/puppeteer-tests/run-quick-test.js

# Test specific workflow
node scripts/puppeteer-tests/05-agent-interaction.js
```

### Before Deployment
```bash
# Full validation
node scripts/puppeteer-tests/run-all-tests.js
```

### Debugging Issues
1. Run individual test script for problematic area
2. Check screenshots in `screenshots/` folder
3. Review detailed results in `results/` folder
4. Browser stays open briefly - watch for visual issues

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test script following existing patterns
2. Add to appropriate pathway in `pathways/`
3. Update main runner in `run-all-tests.js`

### Modifying Test Order
Edit pathway files to change test sequence within each pathway.

### Adjusting Timeouts
Most tests use 2-3 second waits for UI interactions. Increase if needed for slower systems.

## üìö Test Philosophy

**Visual Validation**: Tests run headful to catch styling and UX issues that headless tests miss.

**User Journey Focus**: Tests follow real user workflows rather than isolated component testing.

**Failure Isolation**: Pathway structure allows identifying which major system areas have issues.

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Every critical user interaction is tested to ensure no regressions.

**Performance Awareness**: Tests include pauses and performance observations to catch slowdowns.

This framework ensures Context Pipeline remains functional, well-styled, and provides a great user experience across all critical workflows.
