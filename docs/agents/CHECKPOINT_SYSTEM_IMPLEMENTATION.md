```
### Data Flow
1. **Checkpoint Creation**:
   ```
   User Request → AgentService.createCheckpoint() → CheckpointManager.saveCheckpoint()
   → CheckpointStorage.saveCheckpoint() → File System + Index Update
   ```
2. **Checkpoint Restoration**:
   ```
   User Request → AgentService.restoreFromCheckpoint() → CheckpointManager.loadCheckpoint()
   → CheckpointStorage.loadCheckpoint() → AgentStorageManager.updateAgentFromCheckpoint()
   ```
3. **Checkpoint Search**:
   ```
   Search Query → CheckpointManager.searchCheckpoints() → CheckpointStorage.searchCheckpoints()
   → Index Lookup + Filtering + Sorting → Results
   ```
